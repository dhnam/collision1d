# collision1d
messy and slow 1d collision calculator

# Why?
I'm now high school student, and need to record something in school student record. This is for physics record.

# What?
Collision calculator. Put wall and point of mass in enviroment, give them some property, and process 'until next collision'. Repeat. It will raise `SimulationEndException` when no collision left.

# Inspired by?

check it! It is worth. (Note this is too slow that can't calculate this one properly... Collision between wall, point of mass(m = 1), point of mass(m = 1000000) will take about 10 minutes.)

# Document?
Nope. For now. _will someone ever use it? never mind._
